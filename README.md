### Set up locally:
1. Clone or download [our github repo](https://github.com/AJ-Wuu/SoccerNetPlus) to your computer.
2. Download the official pretrained weights from [here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights), and put `yolov3.weights` under `yolov3_opencv/models` and `yolov3_deepsort/weights`.
3. Get the [test video](https://github.com/AJ-Wuu/SoccerNetPlus/blob/main/video_input/README.md).
4. To make your own copy of the frontend, make an Anvil account and [follow this link](https://anvil.works/build#clone:KSSN3T627CDJ22BL=2KZ5MUAHG2GNGKAA2MEKC3EW). Once the Jupyter notebook is cloned, it can be run locally by embedding it in an html.
5. Connect the frontend and backend code by running the SoccerNetPlus.ipynb jupyter notebook and setting the relevant directory locations in the first block of the notebook.
